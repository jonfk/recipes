ingredients:
  - name: pork skin
timings:
  - time: 30-45min
    for: cooking
notes:
  - Do the cooking outside on a portable stove. The splattering is very hard to clean and prevent.
  - I like to keep the fat on the skin. This means that they won't keep for as long as regular chicharon since fat gets rancid faster than the gelatin in pure skin.
instructions:
  - Boil the pork skin thoroughly. Maybe at least 15mins. The fat needs to be almost cooked through
  - Add a bit of oil to get it started when frying. It will eventually render enough fat to fry but can burn before if no oil is added
  - Fry at medium high heat. On my stove that's currently 6-7
  - Keep an eye on it because it takes a while to cook but can quickly burn
