notes:
  - If the sauce breaks, add water to get it back
  - Eats really well with bread or my favorite rice!
  - Almost as good as Giovanni's on the North shore of Oahu but not quite there
  - Keep the shells to add even better flavor but makes eating inconvinient
  - I also added some soy sauce to add some salty flavour to the sauce
instructions:
  - Microplane or crush about 2 garlic into the shelled shrimps with olive oil and salt
  - Then let marinate for about 30mins
  - Thinly slice about 2 garlic cloves. Doesn't need to be too fine
  - Cook the shrimp in a pan on a medium heat to lightly sear the shrimp without cooking through
  - Take shrimp out of pan
  - Cook sliced garlic with some red pepper flakes until fragrant
  - Deglaze with white wine and cook out alcohol
  - Add butter to emulsify the sauce to finish the sauce 
  - Add back shrimp
  - Finish it off with chopped parsley
