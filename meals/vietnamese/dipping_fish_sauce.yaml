notes:
  - The recipe from https://www.hungryhuy.com/vietnamese-dipping-fish-sauce-recipe-nuoc-cham-nuoc-mam-cham/ was a bit too watery
instructions:
  - Add lime or lemon juice in increments until you like how it tastes. A good guide is it should taste like lemonade/limeade.
  - Add fish sauce in small increments until you like how it tastes. It should be a little strong since it goes on unseasoned food.
  - Top with garlic and chilies and serve.
