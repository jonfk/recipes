instructions:
  - Season the chicken with salt, black pepper, and one tablespoon of grapeseed oil. Broil it until slightly charred and golden, about 10 minutes, and set aside.
  - Heat a thick bottomed 4-quart Dutch oven over medium. Add the oil and flour and, using a whisk, stir constantly, taking care not to allow any to splash and burn you, until the roux has turned dark brown (the color of a bar of Hershey's chocolate is about right), about 25 minutes.
  - Add the garlic, celery, jalape√±o, bell pepper, and onion and cook for one minute. Add the beer to deglaze, then add the stock, thyme, bay leaves, and 1 teaspoon black pepper. Stir slowly and continuously until the gumbo is back to a simmer, then add the chicken thighs and the sausage. Bring to a simmer and cover. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 hours. Gumbo should thick but not like gravy. Season with cayenne and serve with cooked rice. Top with scallions and enjoy!
