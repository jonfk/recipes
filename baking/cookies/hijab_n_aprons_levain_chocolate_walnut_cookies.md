# Hijab and aprons levain chocolate and walnut cookies

- https://www.hijabsandaprons.com/food/levain-bakery-cookies

 ## Notes

- This recipe already has less sugar than usual recipes
- Do not reduce sugar or salt. You can still dust with flaky salt after even with the regular amount in this recipe
- Add a little less walnuts or chop them more finely
- lots of recipes add more butter, could add a little more
- tried it with browned and chilled butter, turned out well but given how little butter there is, it didn't pop out

I tried it with pistachios and half dark/half milk chocolate and it turned out amazing.

## Ingredients (8 cookies)
- ½ cup (112g) butter, slightly softened
- 1 cup (200g) light brown sugar
- ¼ (50g) cup granulated sugar
- 2 eggs, cold
- 1 tsp vanilla extract (imitation works just fine)
- 2½ (300g) cups flour, sifted
- 1½ tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp fine sea salt (or 1 tsp kosher salt)
- 2 cups (250g) walnuts, roughly chopped
    (if omitting walnuts, you can add roughly 50g extra AP flour)
- 2 cups (325g) semi-sweet or dark chocolate chips (I prefer dark chocolate, Guittard’s Extra Dark to be precise)

## Instructions 

- Preheat your oven to 400ºF. If you’re going to bake all 8 cookies now, line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. If you’re going to only bake 4, line one. If you only have one pan but want to bake all 8, line-bake-and-reuse-it.
- Beat the butter and sugar in a large mixing bowl until creamy smooth (about 3 minutes).
- Add the first egg and beat on low-medium speed until fully incorporated. Repeat with the second egg. Then the vanilla extract.
- Mix together the sifted flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
- Carefully pour it all into the mixing bowl. Pulse the mixer/beater a few times to prevent flour from exploding in your face.
- Mix in the walnuts and chocolate chips.
- Now this next step should not be neat. Form and place eight (or four if you want to refrigerate half the dough for later) 6-ounce rough/messy balls of cookie dough into your lined baking sheet. I weighed them so that I would actually yield 8 cookies. Depending on the chocolate chips and walnuts, yours might not come out to 6 ounces each, but that’s the general goal/guideline. Also, if the edges of the cookie dough ball are rough/not smooth, that’s better. In my video, I formed them kind of neatly. In my experience, if you like craggly crispy tops, it’s best if you barely mush it together and smack it onto the pan.
- At this point, if your dough seems like it has softened due to your kitchen's temperature or too much handling with hands, refrigerate the dough-balls for about an hour before baking. When baking in winter, the dough tends to be pretty stiff and solid and doesn’t require chilling.
- Pop the pan(s) into the oven for 10-14 minutes. This time variation depends on your oven (I’m using conventional top and bottom heat, not convection) as well as whether or not you chilled your dough (and for how long). I recommend checking (look, don’t touch) the cookies after they hit the 10 minute mark. Ideally, you want patches of deep golden brown and lighter golden brown.
- If you erred on the side of caution and took the cookies out when they are lighter/too light, let them cool/set in the baking sheet for 15 minutes before serving. If you took them out at the perfect or later time, you can carefully transfer them to a cooling rack after 4-5 minutes of cooling/setting in the pan.
- If you need to reuse your baking sheet for the second batch of 4-cookies, you can do so. Just make sure the pan is clean of grease and has cooled down before you place the dough-balls on it.
 - Lastly, if you’d like to save half of the dough for later in the week, go right ahead. To be completely honest, I’ve never done this because I always have people around me to scarf down the cookies; so I can’t tell you how many days the dough will be good for. I wouldn’t recommend refrigerating it for longer than a week, though.
