## Ingredients

- 100g sugar
- 100g almonds flour
- 2 egg whites
- Finishing salt on top of the macarons
- Some water to dab on the macarons before baking

## Baking

350-355 F for 15-20mins

## Notes

### On sugar

Some recipes have more sugar and others less. It seems to range from 1:1 sugar to almonds ratio to 2:1. I like it less
sweet so going more towards the 1:1.

The addition of finishing salt was something I added and wasn't in any of the recipes I saw but gives a nice little 
boost to the flavour.
