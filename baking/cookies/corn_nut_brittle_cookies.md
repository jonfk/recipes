## Notes

- Made them. Turned out pretty decent. I find the corn nuts not to go that well with the sweet. Even though I like sweet and savory, the corn nuts fights too much with the sweet I find. Maybe it was the corn nuts I used. 
- Would be interested to make this but with oats and a nut brittle.
- Should compare this to Claire saffitz's oatmeal brittle cookies recipe, especially the brown sugar and white sugar ratio.
