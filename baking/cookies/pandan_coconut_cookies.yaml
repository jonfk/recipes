Here are the measurements and directions (grab a scale to make sure the measurements are ACCURATE ðŸ¥°): .: 
Ingredients :. 
384 g all purpose flour 
2 tsp baking powder 
1/2 tsp baking soda 
1/2 tsp salt 
200 g granulated sugar 
227 g butter, room temperature 
2 tsp pandan extract (this is the one I use: https://amzn.to/3qkRpKf) 
2 large eggs 
100 g unsweetened coconut flakes, chopped 

Instructions :. 
1. Beat the butter and sugar together until the butter is light and fluffy, about 3-5 minutes. 
2. Add eggs and pandan extract. Mix together until well combined. 
3. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the coconut flakes, and mix the dry ingredients together. 
4. With the stand mixer on low speed, slowly add the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients a little bit at a time, just until combined (do not over mix). 
5. Using a 1 Â¾ inch ice cream scoop, scoop out the cookies onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. 
6. Chill the dough for at least 1 hour in the fridge. 
7. Bake in a pre-heated 350ÂºF (175ÂºC) oven for 10-15 minutes, or just until the edges of the cookie has set (do not over bake). 
8. Allow cookies to fully cool before enjoying
