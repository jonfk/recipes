## Notes

Very good default snacking cake.

This Cake requires a shallow pan and not a loaf pan unless they are mini loaf pans. I think half the recipe could fit in 2-3 mini loaf pans.

It definitely needs parchment paper or it will stick even to non-stick.

I would try different fruits to this cake recipe. Strawberry is nice but gives a gooey texture where they are inside the cake since they don't dry when cooked. 

I replaced a little bit of the flour with whole wheat pastry flour and it turned out pretty well.

Try it with nuts next time?

## Equipment

* Requires a stand or hand mixer to cream the butter and sugar and eggs
* Definitely needs parchment paper so that it doesn't stick
* Needs a shallow pan to cook. Not loaf pans unless mini

## Ingredients

|Ingredient|Quantity|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Cooking spray|
|all-purpose flour|2 cups/290g|
|baking powder|2 teaspoons/8g|
|kosher salt|¾ teaspoon/3g|
|unsalted butter, at room temperature|1 stick/4 ounces/115g|
|granulated sugar|⅓ cup/70g|
|light brown sugar|⅓ cup/75g|
|vanilla extract|1 teaspoon|
|large eggs|2|
|buttermilk|¾ cup/180g|
|strawberries, hulled and sliced ¼ inch thick (or halved blackberries, blueberries, pitted sweet cherries, sliced peaches, or figs)|10 ounces/295g|
|demerara sugar (you can use granulated sugar in a pinch)|3 tablespoons|
|Baking Soda|1 teaspoon|I added to get extra lift since we are using buttermilk|

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spray the bottom of a 9-inch cake pan with cooking spray and line with parchment paper (either cut to fit the bottom, or leaving some hanging over the edges for easy removal). 
2. In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together. 
3. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle (or in a large bowl with an electric hand mixer), beat the butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla together on medium-high, periodically scraping down the sides of the bowl to make sure everything incorporates, until the mixture is pale, light, fluffy, and creamy, about 5 minutes. 
4. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating to blend after each addition. (This is a good time to scrape down the sides again.) 
5. Reduce the mixer speed to low and carefully add half the flour mixture, followed by half the buttermilk. Repeat with the remaining flour mixture and buttermilk, beating just until no large lumps remain. 
6. Using a spatula, gently fold in half the strawberries and transfer the batter to the prepared cake pan. Scatter with the remaining strawberries and sprinkle with demerara sugar. Bake until the cake is puffed, deeply golden brown, and pulling away at the sides, 45–50 minutes. (It should spring back slightly when pressed in the center and appear fully baked where the strawberries meet the cake.) 
7. Let the cake cool completely before eating.
