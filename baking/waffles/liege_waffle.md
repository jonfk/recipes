Obtained from the back of Lars Own pearl sugar bags.

* 3½ cups flour
* 2.25 teaspoons active dry yeast
* ¾ cup milk (lukewarm)
* 8 oz. butter (2 sticks, softened)
* 2 eggs
* ½ tsp. salt
* 1 tsp. vanilla
* Cinnamon (optional)
* 1 bag pearl sugar 226g

To make, dissolve the yeast in the milk, then gradually add all ingredients except the sugar. Let rise until dough doubles in size (approximately 30 minutes), then add sugar. Divide into small patties (3 to 4 oz. each), then cook on a waffle maker until golden and crisp.
