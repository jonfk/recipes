## Notes

Both recipes are very similar or essentially the same. The oat waffles turned out a little less crispy than I would have preferred but that may have been because I halved the recipe but used more egg ratio than the actual recipe. Might need to retry. 

I would also add more regular rolled oats to the recipe.
