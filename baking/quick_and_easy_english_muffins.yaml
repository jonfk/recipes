notes:
  - Makes about 8 muffins at roughly 3 1/2 inches wide.
  - Split with a fork for the best nooks and crannies.
instructions:
  - Place the Greek yogurt in a large mixing bowl, sift the self-rising flour over it, and stir with a spatula until the dough comes together.
  - Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for a few minutes until smooth, shaping it into a flat ball.
  - Divide into 8 equal portions, roll each into a ball, and pat into 3 1/2-inch pucks about 1/2 inch thick; dust both sides with cornmeal if using.
  - Cover the shaped muffins with a towel and let rest for 15 minutes while you heat a skillet or griddle over medium-low.
  - Brush the hot skillet lightly with oil, add half of the muffins, cover, and cook for about 10 minutes without lifting the lid.
  - Flip the muffins, cover again, and cook another 10 to 12 minutes until golden and about 200F inside; transfer to a rack and repeat with the remaining dough.
  - Cool for at least 10 minutes, then split with a fork and toast if desired.
