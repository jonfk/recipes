  - let puff pastry rest at room temperature
  - in a bowl combine the sugar, the almond powder, the softened butter, one egg, salt, a pinch of baking powder and the almond extract
  - Spread the almond cream over the centre of the first puff pastry
  - leave about 2 inches of space from the edge
  - Beat an egg and brush it on the edge to help sealing the cake properly.
  - Place the second sheet of puff pastry over the cream pushing gently together the edges to seal them tight
  - Secure even more the filling you could use the blunt side of a knife to crimp up the edges, pushing gently down the pastry with a finger.
  - Brush the whole surface with the egg-wash once or twice.
  - With the tip of a knife, gently draw criss-cross lines and pierce the pastry at their intersections to allow the steam to escape.
  - Bake in a pre-heated oven at 200°C-400°F for about 30 minutes or until golden brown.
