# Belgian Waffle

## Yeast Waffles (Brian Lagerstrom)

From Brian Lagerstrom https://youtu.be/Mq6xwcjYQD4?si=-YBdgTBuNoL6SVea

POOLISH

* 200g or 3/4c water, room temp
* Instant yeast (small pinch) 
* 200g or 1 1/4c AP flour (11.7% protein)

To make your poolish, measure water, yeast, and flour into a high sided container. Stir to combine. Allow to sit, covered, at room temp for 12-24 hours. 

WAFFLE BATTER

The default quantities make about 6-7 waffles in the Presto Flipside waffle maker.

|Ingredient|Quantity|Baker's Percent Approx.|
|---|---|---|
|AP flour|275g|100|
|Poolish|400g|145|
|Baking Soda|3g or 3/4 tsp|1|
|Butter|165g|60|
|Milk, Cold|240g|87.3|
|Buttermilk|240g|87.3|
|Egg|1 or 50g|18|
|Sugar|35g|13|
|Vanilla|5g or 1tsp|2|
|Salt|10g|3.6|

* 275g or 2 1/4c AP flour
* 3g or 3/4tsp baking soda
* 165g or 3/4c butter 
* 240g or 1c milk, cold
* 240g or 1c buttermilk 
* 400g of poolish (all poolish from the recipe above)
* 5g or 1tsp vanilla
* 1 large egg
* 10g or 1 3/4tsp salt
* 35g or 1/3c sugar


Preheat small saucepan over high heat and add butter. Butter should foam and eventually milk solids should form at the bottom and become brown. At this point, add cold milk and stir to combine. Add buttermilk and stir. 

Add poolish (everything you made 12-24hrs earlier) into a bowl followed by vanilla, egg, and brown butter milk mix. Whisk to combine. Add flour, salt, sugar, and baking soda. Whisk to combine, trying to get batter as smooth as possible...there will likely still be some small lumps.
