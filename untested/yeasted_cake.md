# My Plan 2023-09-08

I want to use the olive oil brioche recipe with maybe a little less liquids and a little more sugar. Instead of either flavors, I want to use Alison Roman's Lemon & Fennel Olive Oil cake but yeasted instead.

I also checked against Claire Saffitz's semolina olive oil cake which has blood oranges on top/bottom for the ratio of semolina to flour and it more or less matches Alison's at about 50-60% Semolina of flour.

One thing to note is that a yeasted brioche/cake cannot have as much 

|Ingredient|Quantity|Approx. Baker's Percentage|Note|
|---|---|---|---|
|Flour|115g|100|
|Semolina flour|50g|50|
|salt|2g|2|
|honey|40g|40|More than initally called for. Might affect yeast|
|eggs|2|100|a bit more than initially, might need only 1|
|milk|25g|25|
|olive oil|45g|45|
|poolish|100g|100|
|fennel seeds|2g|2|
|lemon zest|||
|lemon extract|1teaspoon||

I bulk fermented it overnight since I didn't have time to cook it the day of. I started the temperature at 450F but dropped it to 400F as soon as it was in the oven. It baked for about 45mins maybe a little less like 40mins. 

The texture was a little dry as I have experienced in the past. It was also not sweet enough, which is also a characteristic I have experienced before for brioche. I guess it would be a pretty good brioche but not a cake.

There was also not very strong fennel or lemon flavours. So maybe put more of those next time.
