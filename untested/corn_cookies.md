### Flavor text

Long before she opened the first Momofuku Milk Bar bakery in New York City in 2008, Christina Tosi knew that one of the signature cookies would be made from corn. Scratch that: It’s not merely made from corn, it emphasizes corn.
“My mom grew up in the cornfields of Ohio,” she says, “and I grew up eating cornmeal and corn bake and spoonbread, and finding this idealized version of cornbread in cookie form was something I just knew I had to do, and the reason the corn cookie exists.”
The compost cookie might be her most famous, but the corn cookie — perhaps because I can never get enough of the taste of sweet summer corn — is my favorite. Soon after Tosi opened the CityCenterDC outlet of Milk Bar in October, drawing lines out the door, I asked if she’d show me how she makes them.
[Make the recipe: Milk Bar Corn Cookies]
In my kitchen, with video cameras rolling, Tosi was full of tips for making sure the homemade cookies don’t pale in comparison with those at the bakery. They include:
Pay attention to the ingredients. That means using good unsalted butter (so you can control the salt amount later) and kosher salt (which gives a nice sharpness). Even more important: the two forms of corn. Seek out corn flour — a finer grind than cornmeal — and corn powder, pulverized freeze-dried corn that Milk Bar sells (or that can be made at home).
Don’t rush the creaming. Tosi wanted to find a way to get an inordinate amount of butter into her cookies without turning them flat and lacy, and she discovered that the longer she creams the butter, sugar and egg in a stand mixer — up to 10 minutes! — the better the cookies will hold. “We’re basically defying cookie gravity,” she says, making for a fudgy center and chewy, crispy edges.
Use a professional “disher.” To achieve the Milk Bar size (large!), use a 2 3/4 -ounce (No. 16) squeeze-release scoop, also known as a disher. “You can use a  1/3 -cup measure, or you can drop these or roll them, but if you make a lot of cookies, a scoop is your friend,” she says. “They make every cookie you bake look like a pro cookie.”
Chill the cookies after forming them. If you’re in a hurry, you can bake the corn cookies right after scooping them. “But for the perfect, perfect cookie, chilling them for one to two hours is ideal, and that’s because we forced so much butter into these,” and chilling keeps the butter from seeping out during baking. “That’s how you make a good cookie into an awesome cookie.”

### Ingredients

16 tablespoons (225 grams, 2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
11/2 cups (300 grams) sugar
1 large egg
11/2 cups packed (225 grams) bread flour
1/4 cup packed corn flour (45 grams; see headnote)
About 2 ounces (65 grams) freeze-dried corn, ground to a powder (2/3 cup packed; see headnote)
3/4 teaspoon (3 grams) baking powder
1/4 teaspoon (11/2 grams) baking soda
11/2 teaspoons (6 grams) kosher salt

### Instructions

1. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Combine the butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer or handheld electric mixer; beat on medium-high speed for 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the egg and beat for 7 to 8 minutes or until very light and fluffy. (Do not rush this step, as it helps the cookie dough incorporate a large amount of butter.) Stop to scrape down the bowl.
3. On low speed, add the bread flour, corn flour, corn powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt; beat just until the dough comes together, no longer than 1 minute.
4. Use a 23/4-ounce ice cream scoop (or a 1/3-cup measure) to portion out all the dough on one of the baking sheets. Pat the tops of the dough domes flat. Wrap the sheet tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or up to 1 week).
5. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
6. Divide the chilled dough portions between the two baking sheets, spacing the portions at least 4 inches apart. Bake for 18 minutes or until the cookies are lightly browned on the edges yet still bright yellow in the center. (They will have puffed, crackled and spread.)
7. Cool the cookies completely on the baking sheets before serving or storing.

## Masa Harina Corn Cookies 

From The Joy of Cooking, Jalisco-Style by Milk Street TV Season 7, Episode 3

https://youtu.be/znkvn-g4Csc?si=QvKY8D15Y15C5Sa-&t=471

These buttery cookies, with the warm, sweet fragrance and flavor of cinnamon and the subtly nutty notes of ground corn, are food writer and recipe developer Paola Briseño-González’ re-creation of the galletas de maíz (corn cookies) from a home bakery in the town of Tuito, in the Mexican state of Jalisco. Made without wheat flour and therefore lacking gluten, the cookies’ texture is quite “short,” similar to shortbread, but more delicate. It’s important to use masa harina here, the type of ground-corn product used to make corn tortillas. Masa harina is processed differently from cornmeal or corn flour, and even from masarepa, which is used to make empanadas and arepas; these different meals and flours are not interchangeable. If masa harina is not sold near the all-purpose flour and cornmeal, check the international aisle. Maseca is a widely available brand. In an airtight container, the cookies will keep for up to four days.

TIP: Don’t worry if the dough feels softer than standard cookie dough, but it should not be wet and sticky. If it is, knead in a little more masa harina, adding only enough so the dough is workable during shaping. These cookies are wheat-free, so there’s no risk of overmixing and making the cookies tough.

### Ingredients 

|Ingredient|Quantity|
|---|---|
|Masa Harina|270g or 2 1/4 cups|
|Baking Powder|1 1/2 teaspoons|
|Ground Cinnamon|1 teaspoon|
|Table Salt|1/2 teaspoon|
|Salted Butter|170g or 12 tablespoon|
|White Sugar|107g or 1/2 cup|
|Large Egg|1|
|Vanilla Extract|1 1/2 teaspoon|

### Instructions

1. Heat the oven to 375°F with a rack in the middle position. Line a rimmed baking sheet with kitchen parchment. In a medium bowl, whisk together the masa harina, baking powder, cinnamon and salt.
2. In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the butter, sugar, egg and vanilla on medium, scraping the bowl once or twice, until the mixture is light and creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. With the mixer running on low, gradually add the dry ingredients, then mix until they are evenly moistened, about 1 minute. With the mixer still running on low, stream in ¼ cup water and mix until the dough is soft and pliable but not sticky, about 30 seconds.
3. Scoop up 1 tablespoon of the dough and roll it into a 3-inch log, then bring the ends together to form a ring. If the dough cracks, it is too dry and needs more water. Return the shaped portion to the mixer bowl and knead in 1 to 2 teaspoons additional water (there is no gluten in the dough and therefore no risk of overworking it). Test the dough by shaping another portion; knead in more water, if needed. When the dough is properly hydrated, form it into rings as you did the first portion; place the rings on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them evenly apart.
4. Bake until the edges of the cookies are golden brown, 13 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately sprinkle with about 2 tablespoons additional sugar. Cool on the baking sheet for about 10 minutes. Using a wide metal spatula, transfer the cookies to a rack; cool completely before serving.

#### Glaze

|Ingredients|Quantity|
|---|---|
|confectioners' sugar, sifted if lumpy|2 cups (227g)|
|orange juice, plus more if needed|3 tablespoons (36g) 
|unsalted butter, melted|1 tablespoon (14g)|
|pinch of salt|

### Instructions
1. To make the cookies: Weigh your masa harina; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.
2. In a large bowl or bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together the masa harina, sugars, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.
3. Add the butter, egg, water, vanilla, and zest all at once. Using a flexible spatula or the flat beater attachment of the stand mixer, stir to combine all the ingredients. The dough will resemble wet sand.
4. Working in the bowl, gently knead the dough to form a smooth, cohesive mass, about 1 minute.
5. Form the dough into a disk about 6" in diameter. Cover with plastic wrap or your favorite reusable wrap and let the dough rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. (This allows the masa harina to fully hydrate.)
6. While the dough rests, place racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 400°F. Line 3 baking sheets with parchment.
7. Lightly dust your work surface and a rolling pin with masa harina. Roll the dough to 1/2" thick (roughly 13" x 8"); the cookies will spread in the oven. If the dough begins to crack, that’s OK; simply press or pinch it back together.
8. Cut the dough into 2 1/4" circles and transfer to the baking sheets, spacing about 3" apart.
9. Re-roll the dough scraps and cut out additional cookies.
10. Starting with 2 of the sheets, bake the orange sugar cookies for 10 to 13 minutes, rotating the pans on the racks from top to bottom halfway through baking. The cookies are done when they are lightly golden brown around the edges.
11. Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool on the pan for 5 minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.
12. Bake the final sheet of cookies in the top third of the oven for 10 to 13 minutes for best results.
13. To make the glaze: In a medium bowl, whisk together the confectioners’ sugar, orange juice, melted butter, and salt. Slowly add more juice, 1 teaspoon at a time, until the glaze is the consistency of thick maple syrup.
14. Set the wire racks of cookies over parchment-lined baking sheets. Dip the top of each cookie in glaze or spread the glaze across the tops of the cookies with a small offset spatula. Set the cookies aside until the glaze has set, about 30 minutes.

Storage information: Store leftover orange sugar cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.
