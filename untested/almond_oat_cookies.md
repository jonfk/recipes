## Instructions

1. Then remove cookies and place directly on cooling rack to finish cooling. 

## Notes from the recipe

* I recommend using weights to measure ingredients rather than cup measures, whenever possible. It gives you a much more accurate measurement since the volume of ingredients like almond flour can be quite different with different brands.
* Cookie dough can rest in the fridge for up to 24 hours before baking, either in a bowl or already scooped into cookie balls.
* To make sure this recipe is completely gluten-free, check your oats to make sure they are certified gluten-free. Some oats are made in processing facilities that are not gluten-free.
* You can use light brown sugar or dark brown sugar for this recipe, or a combination of the two. Dark brown sugar will give you more of a molasses flavor in your cookies.
* Other ingredients can be used as a replacement for the chocolate chips: try raisins, dried cranberries, coconut, butterscotch or white chocolate chips.
* Baked cookies can be stored at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Baked cookies can be frozen for up to 3 months.
* Unbaked cookie dough balls can also be frozen for up to 3 months. Just roll dough into balls and place on a parchment- or wax paper-lined plate in the freezer until firm. Then you can put the cookie dough balls into a freezer-safe ziplock bag and take out however many you want, whenever you want.
