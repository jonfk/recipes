1.   Preheat the oven to 180C/350F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper, and set it aside.
2.   In a large mixing bowl, combine your dry ingredients and mix well. Add the wet ingredients, and mix until combined. Fold through the chocolate chips. If the batter is too thick, add the milk of choice, as needed.
3.   Using a cookie scoop or a large spoon, scoop out heaping tablespoons of dough. Using your hands, roll out balls of cookie dough. Place the balls of cookie dough onto the lined sheet and press each one down slightly.
4.   Bake the cookies for around 10 minutes, or until the edges are beginning to go golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely.
