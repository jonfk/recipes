notes:
  - The sauce can also be cold smoked before it's reduced to add extra smokiness
  - Not sure why it didn't work
  - The garlic powder I used was expired and wasn't very good. Maybe that's why. It was too garlicky in a bad way.
  - The vinegar also had a strange flavor but I don't know why.
instructions:
  - reduce sauce after mixing for about 30min until it thickens
