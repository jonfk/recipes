## Masa Harina Corn Cookies 

From The Joy of Cooking, Jalisco-Style by Milk Street TV Season 7, Episode 3

These buttery cookies, with the warm, sweet fragrance and flavor of cinnamon and the subtly nutty notes of ground corn, are food writer and recipe developer Paola Briseño-González’ re-creation of the galletas de maíz (corn cookies) from a home bakery in the town of Tuito, in the Mexican state of Jalisco. Made without wheat flour and therefore lacking gluten, the cookies’ texture is quite “short,” similar to shortbread, but more delicate. It’s important to use masa harina here, the type of ground-corn product used to make corn tortillas. Masa harina is processed differently from cornmeal or corn flour, and even from masarepa, which is used to make empanadas and arepas; these different meals and flours are not interchangeable. If masa harina is not sold near the all-purpose flour and cornmeal, check the international aisle. Maseca is a widely available brand. In an airtight container, the cookies will keep for up to four days.

TIP: Don’t worry if the dough feels softer than standard cookie dough, but it should not be wet and sticky. If it is, knead in a little more masa harina, adding only enough so the dough is workable during shaping. These cookies are wheat-free, so there’s no risk of overmixing and making the cookies tough.

### Ingredients 

|Ingredient|Quantity|
|---|---|
|Masa Harina|270g or 2 1/4 cups|
|Baking Powder|1 1/2 teaspoons|
|Ground Cinnamon|1 teaspoon|
|Table Salt|1/2 teaspoon|
|Salted Butter|170g or 12 tablespoon|
|White Sugar|107g or 1/2 cup|
|Large Egg|1|
|Vanilla Extract|1 1/2 teaspoon|

### Instructions

1. Heat the oven to 375°F with a rack in the middle position. Line a rimmed baking sheet with kitchen parchment. In a medium bowl, whisk together the masa harina, baking powder, cinnamon and salt.
2. In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the butter, sugar, egg and vanilla on medium, scraping the bowl once or twice, until the mixture is light and creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. With the mixer running on low, gradually add the dry ingredients, then mix until they are evenly moistened, about 1 minute. With the mixer still running on low, stream in ¼ cup water and mix until the dough is soft and pliable but not sticky, about 30 seconds.
3. Scoop up 1 tablespoon of the dough and roll it into a 3-inch log, then bring the ends together to form a ring. If the dough cracks, it is too dry and needs more water. Return the shaped portion to the mixer bowl and knead in 1 to 2 teaspoons additional water (there is no gluten in the dough and therefore no risk of overworking it). Test the dough by shaping another portion; knead in more water, if needed. When the dough is properly hydrated, form it into rings as you did the first portion; place the rings on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them evenly apart.
4. Bake until the edges of the cookies are golden brown, 13 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately sprinkle with about 2 tablespoons additional sugar. Cool on the baking sheet for about 10 minutes. Using a wide metal spatula, transfer the cookies to a rack; cool completely before serving.

#### Glaze

|Ingredients|Quantity|
|---|---|
|confectioners' sugar, sifted if lumpy|2 cups (227g)|
|orange juice, plus more if needed|3 tablespoons (36g) 
|unsalted butter, melted|1 tablespoon (14g)|
|pinch of salt|

### Instructions
1. To make the cookies: Weigh your masa harina; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.
2. In a large bowl or bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together the masa harina, sugars, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.
3. Add the butter, egg, water, vanilla, and zest all at once. Using a flexible spatula or the flat beater attachment of the stand mixer, stir to combine all the ingredients. The dough will resemble wet sand.
4. Working in the bowl, gently knead the dough to form a smooth, cohesive mass, about 1 minute.
5. Form the dough into a disk about 6" in diameter. Cover with plastic wrap or your favorite reusable wrap and let the dough rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. (This allows the masa harina to fully hydrate.)
6. While the dough rests, place racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 400°F. Line 3 baking sheets with parchment.
7. Lightly dust your work surface and a rolling pin with masa harina. Roll the dough to 1/2" thick (roughly 13" x 8"); the cookies will spread in the oven. If the dough begins to crack, that’s OK; simply press or pinch it back together.
8. Cut the dough into 2 1/4" circles and transfer to the baking sheets, spacing about 3" apart.
9. Re-roll the dough scraps and cut out additional cookies.
10. Starting with 2 of the sheets, bake the orange sugar cookies for 10 to 13 minutes, rotating the pans on the racks from top to bottom halfway through baking. The cookies are done when they are lightly golden brown around the edges.
11. Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool on the pan for 5 minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.
12. Bake the final sheet of cookies in the top third of the oven for 10 to 13 minutes for best results.
13. To make the glaze: In a medium bowl, whisk together the confectioners’ sugar, orange juice, melted butter, and salt. Slowly add more juice, 1 teaspoon at a time, until the glaze is the consistency of thick maple syrup.
14. Set the wire racks of cookies over parchment-lined baking sheets. Dip the top of each cookie in glaze or spread the glaze across the tops of the cookies with a small offset spatula. Set the cookies aside until the glaze has set, about 30 minutes.

Storage information: Store leftover orange sugar cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.
